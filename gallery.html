         <h5><i> Drawing 101 </i> (800 X 600)</h5>
		<p>
		In this project, I created a drawing program with code. I approached it with a visualized final product in mind. I had an idea on what kind of aesthetic that I want the program to have. I imagined creating art based on pastels and soft colors. Additionally, I want to create something that fits my personal artistic style. Based on this idea, I searched up a color palette wheel to narrow down the colors I wanted to include in my program. It generated variations of pinks and purples which I felt fit my vision well. <br>

		<p>
          I based this work around the main character from the <i>Legend of Zelda</i> named Link. I worked in a group with members Cassandra Santander, Monzerrat Gomez, and Trang Nguyen. I mapped out their own custom arrays into my project alongside the ones I created.
         </p>
         <p>
          I created 2 distinct arrays, one using color and shape and the other using text. I created 6 more functions for this array that are different from the original. This includes two functions utilizing images. One remapping is a Dark Link version of the original. Another is a Link in which the color is randomized. Lastly, one is a Link made of circles. For the text array, I created another function in which the grid size is different. I mapped out each function twice creating a total of 16 mapped images.

         <h5><i>Untitled</i> (600 X 600)</h5>
		<p>
            For this work, I created various ‘creatures’ based on the classic arcade game <i>Pacman</i>. First I created custom functions for Pacman’s body. I then created a bow function to create Mrs. Pacman. I then created child functions for the Ghosts of the game. Then in each parent function, I changed the color of the bodies. I created a vulnerable ghost (what appears after Pacman eats a ghost) based on the same functions for the normal ones. I did add a new set of functions for its eyes and mouth. Additionally to the characters, I created functions for a cherry object and the pellet that is in the original game. I added an image to the background to replicate the original game. After that, I created different arguments which moved my characters around.

		<p>
            For this work, I created  a class based on the red ghost I created from <i>Untitled</i>. Within the ghost class, I created three different methods. One changes the speed of the ghosts, the other changes the size, and the last changes the rotation. I made an array based on the ghost class and set the number to 15. I added a mousepressed function which triggers the various methods in the class.

          <h5><i>In Reality</i></h5>
          <p><i>In Reality</i> was my big project that a lot of my work was created for. Originally, there was only one short chapter
          but after I finished the first, I couldn't help myself but to make the second. This game is about a person's journey through
          the afterlife. The main point of the story game is to discover why this person died. There are multiple options, some which leads
          to dead ends. To find out more, click on the image above to see the official website for this story game.</p>

           pushes this narrative is the audio track accompanying my Gif of a clock ticking. I hope my audience feels nervous upon
            hearing and watching my video.</p>

             <h5><i>Burnout</i> (1920 x 1080)</h5>
           <p>
            <i>Burnout</i> is my favorite video that I created. It is about how draining it could be to a student and how they struggle
             to stay focused. Students would rather do anything else than pay attention. This is because they are experiencing burnout. Even
             when the person in the video was trying to study, they couldn't comprehend anything they were reading. Only when this student
             goes outside, away from the draining environment of the library, does the tone of the video change. They feel at peace and as if
             they were free. I myself was experiencing burnout during the filming of this video, which I hinted to at the end. This video was
             filmed with my phone and edited together uding Adobe Premiere Pro. I recorded the sounds with Voice Memos then edited it into a cohesive
             soundtrack.

           First, I filmed multiple clips using my phone. This was before I purchased a professional
            camera but I feel like it adds to the nature of this video. I used Adobe Premiere Pro to
            edit the clips together as well as add background music. The people in the video are actually
            my roommates. </p>

          <h5><p><i>Halloween Cat</i> (1024 x 768)</p></h5>
          <p><i>
            There resides a peculiar statue of a cat at
            the abandoned house a bit away from the others. This cat is no ordinary cat as it has two extra tails and horns sticking out of its little witches hat. Though it has a strange look, the mystery of the cat is even stranger. Every year, on Halloween day, the cat disappears without a trace behind, then the day after, the cat is back as if it were never gone in the first place. The oddest occurrences happen Halloween night. The webs that adorn the decorated houses end up on the street, the lamps flicker at an unusual pace, and the children are saddened that their candy mysteriously disappears every year. Where does it end up you may ask? Why, in the pumpkin that forever stands next to that mysterious cat.
