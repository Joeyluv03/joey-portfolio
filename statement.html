            In the beginning of my artistic journey, I focused heavily on
            character design without much thought behind it. First it would
            start with an idea, influenced by the popular media that surrounded
            me. That idea would come to life through a simple pencil sketch and
            for years that was my process. Although it was great practice, I
            started to shift my artistic vision into wanting to bring my
            sketches to life. I achieved this by focusing on pictorial pieces,
            with an emphasis on watercolor on wood as my medium of choice. It
            was during this time that I would experiment with creating art in
            the digital space. Digital illustrations are typically where most
            artists start when getting into the technological realm. It was no
            different for me. As I entered college, I wanted to explore the
            digital space more. All of my pieces are experimental as I attempt
            new techniques. However, one thing that ties all of my works
            together, both the pictorial pieces from before and the digital
            creations of today, is the concept. A great majority of my pieces
            focus on mental health and a few are even based on my own
            experiences and interests.
            <br />It is important that my works are somewhat relevant to my own
            experiences because I feel that it allows me as the artist to get
            closer to the audience. There is something personal and raw about
            sharing my feelings and experiences without being completely
            obvious. It is the little influences from my personal life that
            makes the pieces more powerful. For example, in the game I created
            titled <i>In Reality</i>, a lot of it was based on my own feelings.
            It felt real which is something that I strive for with a lot of my
            personal work. In future works, I would like to stick with using
            myself as inspiration for my pieces; however, I want to create them
            in a broader narrative. My goals beyond my college career include
            diving into the gaming world which I have already started to
            experiment with. In that space, I think my ideas would come alive
            more thoroughly than I have been able to achieve in the past because
            of the added narrative of gameplay on top of the theme. Even in my
            first attempt at game creation, I felt like my ideas were realized
            in a way I have always envisioned.

            <br />My artistic style has always taken influences from anime and
            cartoons (including games with that style). Even in my pictorial
            works, my style stays consistent. In terms of my works as a whole,
            they tend to be on the darker side because I talk about darker
            things. Some of my pieces though, were created solely for the
            purpose of experimenting with different techniques. Those ones tend
            to be happier. They still hold my own influence though because they
            are based on my personal interests. <br />Overall, I am proud of
            what I was able to showcase, especially knowing where I started
            from. I believe that my works are only going to get better as I
            become more experienced as a digital artist.
